# Automated Testing Samples

This is a sample project to illustrate some aspects of a 'good' automated test. 

It was created along with the blog post [Anatomy of a Good Test](https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/anatomy-of-a-good-test/) 
written by [@jacek_bilski](https://twitter.com/jacek_bilski) and [@torstenmandry](https://twitter.com/torstenmandry). 

The sample code is written in Java. The test code is based on [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/), 
[Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) and [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/).
